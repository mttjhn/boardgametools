boardgametools
==============
Personal utilities built in node.js using [monteslu's](https://github/com/monteslu) excellent bgg client for Node.js ([github repo](https://github.com/monteslu/bgg)). I use this primarily to compile a list of games I've played during the month, with my own hacked-together templating engine.

## What It Does...
Currently, the project fires up a basic site that searches through my BGG play data and comes up with a list of games I've played during the past month, using a template that I've defined to make it easier to post to geeklists on BGG.
